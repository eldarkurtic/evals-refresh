# Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B — AIME 2026

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | `inspect_evals/aime2026` (30 problems (AIME I + II), integer answers) |
| Category | knowledge-and-reasoning (subclass: math-reasoning) |
| Exec tier | `none` — no Docker, no sandbox, no tools |
| vLLM recipe | https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B |

Answers are matched numerically after stripping `\boxed{}`; the prompt asks for `ANSWER: $ANSWER` on the
last line. With only 30 problems, `EPOCHS` (default 8, avg@8) drives the standard error. Dataset pinned at revision `79037aebdb`.

## Files

- `serve.sh` — deploys the model with a vLLM server. vLLM-serve arguments live here
  (parallelism, context length, reasoning/tool parsers), taken from the official recipe.
- `run_eval.sh` — runs the Inspect task against that server. Inspect-side params live here
  (task, epochs, sampling params, reasoning effort, max tokens, concurrency).
- `server_requirements.txt` / `client_requirements.txt` — `pip freeze` of the vLLM and Inspect
  venvs that produced the results below, with the host (GPUs, driver, CUDA, Python) in the header.
- `local_orchestrator.sh` — runs everything in your local dev environment: activates the
  venvs, sets GPUs, starts `serve.sh` in the background, runs `run_eval.sh`, tears down.
  **This is the only file you should modify** to match the environment you run in.

## Run

### Setup (once per host)

`local_orchestrator.sh` activates two virtualenvs, `~/.venvs/vllm` for the server and `~/.venvs/inspect` for the
Inspect client; create them as below (edit the paths in `local_orchestrator.sh` if you keep them elsewhere).
`server_requirements.txt` and `client_requirements.txt` are the exact `pip freeze` of the environments that
produced the results below (Python 3.12, host details in their headers): installing from them reproduces those
environments; the commented alternative gives an equivalent fresh install with the same pinned versions.

```bash
# server: vLLM 0.29.0 (CUDA 13 wheels; add the matching https://download.pytorch.org/whl/<cuXXX> index if pip cannot resolve torch)
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/vllm && source ~/.venvs/vllm/bin/activate
pip install -r server_requirements.txt          # or: pip install vllm==0.29.0
# client: Inspect
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/inspect && source ~/.venvs/inspect/bin/activate
pip install -r client_requirements.txt          # or:
# pip install "inspect-evals==0.20.0" openai
```

Model weights and datasets are fetched from the Hugging Face Hub on first use into the usual cache (`HF_HOME`
if set). Export `HF_TOKEN` in your shell before running (never in the repo); nothing here is gated, but anonymous Hub
downloads are rate-limited.

### Run the eval

```bash
./local_orchestrator.sh
inspect view --log-dir ./logs
```

Always smoke-test first: `EPOCHS=1 ./local_orchestrator.sh --limit 5`

## Results

With model generation config:

`temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, reasoning_effort=xhigh, max_tokens=131072, max_connections=128, client_timeout=7200, epochs=8 (mean)`

the following scores and token stats are obtained:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| accuracy (avg@8) | 0.979 |
| stderr | 0.0121 |
| per-epoch accuracy | 1.00 / 0.97 / 0.97 / 1.00 / 1.00 / 0.93 / 0.97 / 1.00 |
| samples | 240 (30 problems x 8 epochs) |
| problems solved 8/8 | 27 (problem 10: 6/8, 15: 6/8, 28: 7/8) |
| truncated (stop_reason=max_tokens) | 0 |
| unparsed answers | 1 |
| sample errors | 0 |

| tokens / sample | input | output | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean | 274 | 20,455 | 19,552 |
| median | 271 | 16,598 | 15,435 |
| max | 512 | 100,807 | 99,017 |

Total run time about 32 min on 8x H100 (128 concurrent samples).

## Patches for upstream
