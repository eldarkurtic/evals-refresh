# Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B — GPQA-Diamond

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | `inspect_evals/gpqa_diamond` (198 questions, 4 choices) |
| Category | knowledge-and-reasoning (subclass: science-reasoning) |
| Exec tier | `none` — no Docker, no sandbox, no tools |
| vLLM recipe | https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B |

## Files

- `serve.sh` — deploys the model with a vLLM server. vLLM-serve arguments live here
  (parallelism, context length, reasoning/tool parsers), taken from the official recipe.
- `run_eval.sh` — runs the Inspect task against that server. Inspect-side params live here
  (task, epochs, sampling params, reasoning effort, max tokens, concurrency).
- `local_orchestrator.sh` — runs everything in your local dev environment: activates the
  venvs, sets GPUs, starts `serve.sh` in the background, runs `run_eval.sh`, tears down.
  **This is the only file you should modify** to match the environment you run in.

## Run

```bash
./local_orchestrator.sh
inspect view --log-dir ./logs
```

Always smoke-test first: `EPOCHS=1 ./local_orchestrator.sh --limit 5`

## Results

## (optional) Patches for inspect-ai
