# Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B — SWE-bench Pro

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | `inspect_harbor/scale_ai_swe_bench_pro` (731 tasks, Harbor hub package digest `sha256:88411d32…`, loaded through `assets/harbor_registry.json`, which pins the tasks to the fork commit carrying the verifier fixes, see Patches) |
| Category | agentic-and-coding (subclass: swe-agent) |
| Exec tier | `agent` — one Docker image per task built from `FROM jefzda/sweap-images:<instance>` (Docker Hub) plus a git reset, bash/python tools, hidden test verifier |
| vLLM recipe | https://recipes.vllm.ai/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B |
| Task source | https://hub.harborframework.com/datasets/scale-ai/swe-bench-pro |

**Protocol note.** The model card reports 61.7 (Claude Code harness, on a corrected task set). `inspect_harbor` solves every task with Inspect's generic ReAct agent
(`bash`, `python`, `update_plan`, `submit`; 300 s tool timeout; automatic context compaction; no message limit),
not the Claude Code harness. Harbor's per-task agent budget is not applied by `inspect_harbor`; a single
`--time-limit 14400` wall-clock guard is used. Containers run without Harbor's CPU cap (`override_cpus=0`) and
with `inspect_harbor`'s 6 GB memory floor. One epoch (pass@1) instead of the repo's usual avg@3. All in-flight
samples share one vLLM server (one TP=8 replica so the prefix cache stays local; 56 samples in flight, what its
4M-token KV cache holds once histories average 45k tokens). The numbers are therefore not directly comparable to
the model cards.

## Files

- `assets/harbor_registry.json` — Harbor registry entry pinning the 731 tasks to the fork commit that carries the verifier fixes (see Patches).
- `serve.sh` — deploys the model with a vLLM server. vLLM-serve arguments live here
  (parallelism, context length, reasoning/tool parsers), taken from the official recipe.
- `run_eval.sh` — runs the Inspect task against that server. Inspect-side params live here
  (task and package digest, epochs, sampling params, per-turn max tokens, concurrency, sandbox count, time limit).
- `server_requirements.txt` / `client_requirements.txt` — `pip freeze` of the vLLM and Inspect
  venvs that produced the results below. The client venv is the `inspect-harbor` one (see Run).
- `local_orchestrator.sh` — runs everything in your local dev environment: activates the
  venvs, sets GPUs and TP/DP, points Docker at the rootless daemon, starts `serve.sh` in the background,
  runs `run_eval.sh`, tears down. **This is the only file you should modify** to match the
  environment you run in.

## Run

### Setup (once per host)

`local_orchestrator.sh` activates two virtualenvs, `~/.venvs/vllm` for the server and `~/.venvs/inspect-harbor` for the
Inspect client; create them as below (edit the paths in `local_orchestrator.sh` if you keep them elsewhere).
`server_requirements.txt` and `client_requirements.txt` are the exact `pip freeze` of the environments that
produced the results below (Python 3.12, host details in their headers): installing from them reproduces those
environments; the commented alternative gives an equivalent fresh install with the same pinned versions.

```bash
# server: vLLM 0.29.0 (CUDA 13 wheels; add the matching https://download.pytorch.org/whl/<cuXXX> index if pip cannot resolve torch)
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/vllm && source ~/.venvs/vllm/bin/activate
pip install -r server_requirements.txt          # or: pip install vllm==0.29.0
# client: Inspect
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/inspect-harbor && source ~/.venvs/inspect-harbor/bin/activate
pip install -r client_requirements.txt          # what produced the results (inspect-harbor 0.7.5); or the current setup:
# pip install "inspect-harbor>=1.0" httpx2 "openai==3.14.0"
```

`inspect-harbor` pulls in `litellm`, which pins `openai<3`, while Inspect's OpenAI-compatible providers need
`openai>=3`; installing `openai==3.14.0` last overrides the pin (pip prints a conflict warning that is harmless
here because Inspect's agent path never imports `litellm`). `httpx2` is imported by `inspect-ai` but not declared.

Model weights and datasets are fetched from the Hugging Face Hub on first use into the usual cache (`HF_HOME`
if set). Export `HF_TOKEN` in your shell before running (never in the repo); nothing here is gated, but anonymous Hub
downloads are rate-limited.

Docker (with the compose plugin) must be reachable by your user. `local_orchestrator.sh` exports `DOCKER_HOST` for
a rootless daemon (`unix:///run/user/<uid>/docker.sock`, image store under `~/.local/share/docker`); with a
rootful daemon drop that export. Check the image-store disk space quoted below before the first run. Rootless
Docker needs a runc runtime with `NoNewKeyring` in `daemon.json` (one kernel key per container otherwise
exhausts a user's quota of 200) and cannot apply CPU limits, hence `-T override_cpus=0` in `run_eval.sh`.

### Run the eval

```bash
./local_orchestrator.sh
inspect view --log-dir ./logs
```

Always smoke-test first: `EPOCHS=1 ./local_orchestrator.sh --limit 2`

Requires Docker. **What to expect on the first run:** Harbor downloads the task definitions into
`~/.cache/harbor/tasks/packages/`, then Each task's image is built from a per-instance base image on Docker Hub (731 pulls at the anonymous limit of 100
per hour, 1 to 5 GB each). Inspect builds images serially before any sample starts, so pre-pull and pre-build them
(`docker build -t hb__scale-ai-<task> environment/`) and run in batches if the image store cannot hold all 731.
Later runs reuse the images.

## Results

With model generation config:

`temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, reasoning_effort=xhigh, max_tokens=65536 (per turn), no message limit, time_limit=14400s, client_timeout=7200, tool_timeout=300s, TP=8 DP=1, epochs=1; 731 tasks in 5 runs of 101 / 79 / 307 / 214 / 33 tasks at 56 samples in flight (the 214-task run retuned live to 48)`

the following scores and token stats are obtained:

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| resolved rate (pass@1, 1 epoch) | 0.756 (551 of 729 scored tasks) |
| stderr (binomial) | 0.0159 |
| samples | 731 of 731 tasks, 1 epoch, in 5 run(s): 101 + 79 + 307 + 214 + 33 |
| time-limit hits (14400 s) | 0 |
| turns truncated at max_tokens | 0 |
| context compactions | 13 |
| sample errors (excluded from the score) | 2 (instance_gravitational__teleport-02d1efb8560a1aa1c72cfb1c08e, instance_gravitational__teleport-2b15263e49da562592258156983) |

| tokens / sample | input | output | reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| mean | 3,459,141 | 43,183 | 29,351 |
| median | 2,393,603 | 38,124 | 25,653 |
| max | 24,733,351 | 213,719 | 156,133 |

Input tokens are cumulative over agent turns (history is resent each turn). Agent turns per
sample: median 56, mean 63, max 284. Wall time per sample: median 1,785 s,
mean 2,148 s, max 9,315 s. The agent ends when the model replies without a tool call (no `submit` tool is used);
the verifier then scores the container state. Total run time about 10 h 27 min on 8x H100 across the runs.

Per repository (resolved / tasks): ansible 71/96, internetarchive 75/91, flipt-io 47/85, qutebrowser 63/79, gravitational 48/74, protonmail 47/65, future-architect 53/62, navidrome 52/57, element-hq 40/56, nodebb 37/44, tutao 18/20.

The oracle solver (reference solutions, run on every batch before the model) cannot pass 8 of the 731 tasks;
they are scored like any other task (both models resolved 0 of them, except one teleport task Gemma resolved):
`ansible-de5858f4` (a required test id contains JSON and never matches the parser; 58/58 tests pass),
`element-web-aec454dd` (11 InviteDialog tests missing from the run output; 189/200 required pass),
`vuls-bff6b755` (7/7 tests pass but only 4 required ids match), `nodebb-00c70ce7` (the reference solution fails
one required test), and `teleport-87a59351`, `teleport-baeb2697`, `teleport-bb562408`, `teleport-eefac60a`
(the teleport test build exceeds Harbor's 3000 s verifier budget; timing-dependent). The 2 sample errors are
the same verifier timeout on two other teleport tasks and are excluded from the score.

`inspect_harbor`'s agent enables Inspect's context compaction; Inspect cannot read a vLLM model's context window
and falls back to a 128k-token threshold (the model's window is 262k), which compacted the history 13 times in
11 samples.

## Patches for upstream

Three environment defects in the published tasks make several task families ungradable as published (the reference
solutions score 0), all in the verifier scripts:

- ansible-test lowers its own soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` to 1024 and runs `pytest -n auto`; with 384 visible CPUs xdist
  spawns 384 workers, pytest dies with `EMFILE` before running a test, and the verifier reports 0 passed tests even
  for the reference solution. Fixed by running every `ansible-test` call under `taskset -c 0-3` (bounds worker
  count only). Upstream: https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor-datasets/pull/258.
- the images ship `/etc/pip.conf` pointing at a build-time mirror (`http://127.0.0.1:9876/`) that no longer exists,
  which breaks the tasks whose test run installs requirements. Fixed in the same PR (the file is removed first).
- `inspect_harbor` 0.7.x ran the verifier as `bash -l /tests/test.sh`; in the Go repositories' images `/etc/profile`
  resets `PATH`, `go` is not found and 0 tests run. Fixed upstream in inspect_harbor 1.0.0
  (https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_harbor/pull/174, verifier no longer uses a login shell).

This directory consumes the dataset fix from the fork: `assets/harbor_registry.json` pins every task to commit
`2494eda6ae` of https://github.com/eldarkurtic/harbor-datasets (branch `swebenchpro/verifier-env-fixes`, the
content of PR #258), and `run_eval.sh` loads it with `inspect_harbor/harbor -T registry_path=... -T
dataset_name_version=swebenchpro@1.0`; Harbor fetches the task files from GitHub at that commit. It needs
`inspect-harbor>=1.0` for the verifier fix. The results below were produced with inspect_harbor 0.7.5 on a local copy
of the hub package with the same verifier changes plus a `PATH` restore that 0.7.5 needed; the pinned setup was
verified afterwards with `--solver inspect_harbor/oracle` on ansible, flipt-io and qutebrowser tasks. Once PR #258 is
merged and the hub package republished, switch back to `inspect_harbor/scale_ai_swe_bench_pro -T ref=<digest>` and
delete the registry file. Host-side measures that are not part of the task (pre-built images to stay under Docker
Hub's pull limit, UID rewriting for rootless Docker) are described in `local_env_notes.md`.
